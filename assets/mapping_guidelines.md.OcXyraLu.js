This differs from Source 1&#39;s brush system whereby the world is built with &quot;blocks&quot;. The new mesh based system offers a far more intuitive approach to building your map however will require some background research if you&#39;re coming from Source 1. It is highly recommended that you move towards this new system if you haven&#39;t already since many optimisation issues previously manageable within Source 1 will not work the same way and can lead to later visual issues under Source 2&#39;s mesh based system.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdSDojRatHw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Source 2 101 - Hammer Crash Course #1 : Good workflow habits</a>, by Eagle One Development Team</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo1LwsCqp_M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Counter-Strike 2 Hammer - Wall niches / doors / windows / tunnels</a>, by ReDMooNTV</p><h2 id="design-detailing" tabindex="-1">Design/Detailing <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-detailing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design/Detailing&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To secure a spot in the <code>Global Map pool</code>, your map requires more than just functional gameplay. It needs a level of visual polish that goes beyond the basics. Maps that consist of &quot;box rooms&quot; with flat textures tiled across large surfaces are typically rejected, as they lack the effort and environmental depth expected for global standards.</p><p>Break up massive, flat walls by introducing architectural geometry that disrupts the room&#39;s silhouette. Adding structural elements like pillars, recessed wall panels, or trim where surfaces meet creates natural highlights and shadows, transforming a hollow shell into an intentional space.</p><p>Stay away from the &quot;jumps along a wall&quot; design where players simply follow a linear path through a boxy corridor. Instead, utilize the full 3D volume of your room to force changes in elevation and direction. Integrate your platforms into the environment itself—rather than using generic floating blocks, have players navigate across protruding vents, hanging machinery, or natural rock formations. This grounds the gameplay in a cohesive setting and ensures the map feels like a complete world rather than a simple test room.</p><div style="display:flex;gap:5px;"><div style="flex:1;"><img src="'+r+'" alt="Barren kz_insomnia" style="width:100%;display:block;"><p style="text-align:center;margin:10px 0;"><em>1.

While the context changes from map to map, generally speaking this means that your lighting should strike a balance between being visually appealing and readable for gameplay.</p><p><code>light_environment</code> for sunlight will in most cases provide adequate lighting, however it&#39;s worth trying different angles, brightness and colour for the light to see what looks the best.</p><p>In shaded areas of your map, it may be necessary to incorporate a secondary light source to provide better visibility, however in doing so, it is recommended that the light is complimented by a source such as a candle or light bulb prop.</p><div style="display:flex;gap:5px;"><div style="flex:1;"><img src="'+n+'" alt="Bad lighting" style="width:100%;display:block;"><p style="text-align:center;margin:10px 0;"><em>1.

Only use light ranges higher than 1024 units sparingly as this can negatively impact fps and compile times.</p><p>To see an accurate representation of your lighting and shadows while you work, enable the <code>GPU Reference Path Tracing</code> option located in the top-right corner of your viewport window. This provides a highly accurate preview of how light bounces and materials will appear in-game, allowing you to fine-tune your atmosphere without needing to run a full compile.</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+p+'" alt="GPUPathTracing" style="max-width:400px;display:block;margin:0 auto;"><p style="margin:10px 0;"><em>3.

Best practice is to always do a final compile for your map which by default is set to 2048 resolution. Below this resolution you are more likely to encounter lighting artifacts, especially in darker areas of the map. In larger maps with more light space it may be necessary to compile your map at a lightmap resolution higher than 2048.</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+d+'" alt="Artifacting" style="max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;"><p style="margin:10px 0;"><em>3. Lighting artifacts due to low lightmap resolution</em></p></div><p>With this in mind you also want to avoid calculating lighting for areas of the map never visible to the player. The first step in achieving this is to cull lightmap space from your map by deleting unnecessary faces. Any face that will never be visible to the player should be deleted (assuming it is not contributing to vis). The second step is to incorporate a lightmap playerspace mesh. This is a brush material which tells the engine where to calculate high resolution lightmap space and will tell the engine where lightmap space should be prioritised.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/VGxPXnGJ0wM?si=XKQLfUU9U4Ijs_fJ&amp;t=135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Counter-Strike 2 Hammer - Basic Map Optimisations (compile time)</a>, by ReDMooNTV</p><h3 id="light-probes-and-cubemaps" tabindex="-1">Light probes and cubemaps <a class="header-anchor" href="#light-probes-and-cubemaps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Light probes and cubemaps&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Light probes and cubemaps are required for your map and can be incorporated simultaneously with the <code>env_combined_light_probe_volume</code> entity. Light probes are required to create diffuse lighting on entities which cannot utilise direct lighting such as prop_dynamic entities. Cubemaps are required to create proper reflections for material surfaces and your view model (Image 4 &amp; 6). This is achieved by projecting a three dimensional image of a room onto the surfaces within the bounds of the entity.</p><div style="display:flex;gap:15px;"><div style="flex:1;"><img src="'+c+'" alt="Present light probe" style="width:100%;display:block;"><p style="text-align:center;margin:10px 0;"><em>4.

Combined light probe present</em></p></div></div><p>To implement lightprobes and cubemaps you should aim to place an <code>env_combined_light_probe_volume</code> in every room of your map. The origins of these entities should be positioned in the center of each room at player head height. You may need to adjust the position of the origin using the pivot manipulation tool (ins key). For example if the room has multiple elevations, raising the entity origin to a height between the floor and the ceiling may create more accurate reflections. If an object is obstructing the light probe, ensure that the origin is not placed within or halfway through that object. After determining the location for the origin of the entity, the bounds should be extruded to encapsulate the entirety of the room. Recompile and you should now see reflections on your weapon models and the surfaces of your map.</p><p>In some instances a seam will appear between two volumes due to a difference between the lighting of each room. To soften the transition between the volumes, within the object properties assign an edge fade distance of 8 or 16 units (Image 11). When applying edge fade, ensure the volume edges overlap by twice the distance of your edge fade distance to maintain a smooth blend (Images 8, 9).</p><p>When placing combined light probes near walls, floors, or ceilings, extend the volume so the edge fade overlaps the surface. If the fade ends exactly at the wall, the lighting influence drops to zero, and the surface won&#39;t receive proper reflections or bounce light (image 5).</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+g+'" alt="Artifacting" style="max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;"><p style="margin:10px 0;"><em>7.

Combined light probe with fade and overlap</em></p></div></div><p>Irregularly shaped rooms often force light probe volumes to overlap awkwardly through walls into adjacent spaces. This will occasionally cause surfaces to sample the wrong light probes. To fix this use the priority system to &#39;force&#39; the correct probe to take precedent (Image 11). Usually, you’ll want the probe that best fits the specific room&#39;s shape or lighting to have the higher priority.</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>When two or more volumes are set to the same priority, the engine will determine the priority based on the hierachy of the entity id.</p></div><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+f+'" alt="Probepuzzle" style="max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;"><p style="margin:10px 0;"><em>10.

If an object is a non-vis contributor, the engine will still render everything behind it, which can severely impact performance. To prevent this, structural geometry such as walls, floors and ceilings should be kept as vis contributors.</p><p>VIS is calculated during the map&#39;s compilation phase and, along with lighting, is one of the most resource-intensive parts of the process. Poor optimization can cause compile times to skyrocket. VIS functions most efficiently with simple &quot;boxes&quot; and straight surfaces, problems arise when you add complex details inside a room. These detailed elements should be set as non-vis contributors.</p><p>In technical terms, VIS operates using cubes called voxels. These voxels fill the playable space, &quot;communicating&quot; with one another to determine line-of-sight and visibility.</p><p>If these voxels are too large or extend into the &quot;void&quot; (the empty space outside your map&#39;s sealed geometry), it will cause a VIS Leak. When a leak occurs, the engine fails to distinguish between the inside and outside of the map, often resulting in the entire world being rendered at once or the compilation process failing entirely. Ensure your outer structural hull is perfectly sealed to keep the voxel calculation contained.</p><p>The entity <code>visibility_hint</code> allows you to manually control the size of these voxels in specific areas. While using larger voxels can significantly reduce your compile times, you must be careful, if they are too large, they may fail to properly respect your map&#39;s boundaries and bleed into the void, resulting in a VIS leak. Larger open maps such as infinite water maps can use higher voxel sizes.</p><p>To visualize how the engine is &quot;thinking,&quot; you can view these voxels directly in Hammer. Navigate to the Map dropdown menu and select <code>Load Compiled Vis Data</code>. This will overlay the voxel grid and vis clusters onto your 3D view, allowing you to identify areas where the density might be too high or where voxels might be bleeding toward the void.</p><p>To visualize which objects in your map are currently affecting visibility, click the &quot;Visibility contributors view&quot; button located in the toolbar (see image below).</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+v+'" alt="viscontribs" style="max-width:60px;display:block;margin:0 auto;"><p style="margin:10px 0;"><em>11. &quot;Visibility contributors view&quot; button</em></p></div><p>In CS:GO, visibility was managed by converting geometry into <code>func_detail</code>. Source 2 follows a similar logic, but the workflow depends on the asset type. While models are non-vis contributors by default, mesh geometry must be manually configured. To prevent a mesh from affecting visibility, you must enable the <code>Not a Vis Contributor</code> setting within the mesh&#39;s properties.</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+k+'" alt="nonvis" style="max-width:400px;display:block;margin:0 auto;"><p style="margin:10px 0;"><em>11.

Here we have listed some of the more useful ones with tips on how to use them.</p><ul><li><code>Csgo Environment</code> shader</li></ul><p>This shader allows <strong>PBR</strong> layering for generic materials such as wall, floor and terrain surfaces.</p><p>Although only a colour/texture file is required for the shader to function, you should aim to generate normal and roughness maps at a minimum to provide your materials with realistic topography and surface reflectivity.</p><p>Coming from Source 1 you may have used the lightmapped generic shader for your generic materials. While this shader is still available in Source 2, it should only be used sparingly as it lacks many of the features and fidelity offered by alternative shaders.</p><p>If you’re planning to use a material texture which lacks other PBR layers, you can generate them yourself. For those who want fast results you can quickly generate these layers from a colour texture using <a href="https://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NormalMap Online</a> or <a href="https://github.com/maikramer/Materialize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">materialize</a>.</p><p>You can also generate the layers manually using an appropriate photo editing software such as Gimp, Photoshop or Blender.</p><ul><li><code>Csgo Environment Blend</code> shader</li></ul><p>The environment blend shader allows you to combine two materials and create smooth transitions between those materials with the texture paint tool.</p><div class="warning custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>Explain how it is used in Hammer.</p></div><ul><li><code>Csgo Water Fancy</code> shader</li></ul><p>If you don’t plan on adding water to your map you can ignore this shader. If you do, it is imperative that you create a custom water material rather than using the stock assets.</p><p>The easiest way to prepare a water material using this shader is to decompile a water material already available in the game. This will allow you to see how the shader properly functions.</p><p>Most people’s first issue when using stock water is that the surface starts to fade the further it is located from the world origin. To adjust the fade distance, change the UV max and minimum values.</p><ul><li><code>Csgo Complex</code> shader</li></ul><p>The Csgo Complex shader offers experimental properties for your materials such as emissive lighting, transparency, animation and movement.</p><p>To create Neon/Glowing/Illuminated materials with the “Csgo Complex” shader tick the “Self Illum” box. Scroll down and set the “Self Illum Mask” to white. Play around with the “Brightness” and “Albedo Factor” slider.</p><p>With glowing materials it&#39;s important to remember that it will cause light artifacting VERY easily if the light is mainly coming from Self Illum materials. Thats why it&#39;s recommended to disable &quot;Emissive Lighting&quot; under the mesh properties. Emissive in this case means that it reflects light from itself onto other things (it&#39;s bad)</p><p>To make the glowing material appear as “glowing” (without as many problems) a combination of Post Processing (with bloom) and the use of light entities is recommended. Good light entities for this case could be “light_rect” and “light_omni2” with either a sphere or one of the tubes as a light shape. Remember that less light entities are better than many.</p><p>Transparent materials are also done with the Csgo Complex shader. Just tick the “Translucent” box and configure it. For this you will need an alpha mask (ZONE GRADIANT) (example image).</p><ul><li><code>Csgo Static Overlay</code> shader</li></ul><p>Can be used to project materials onto faces. The best use case for this would be images/art/lj numbers. This shader does also have the translucent option.</p><p>Why does this differ from just making a face with Csgo Complex?</p><p>Well because faces tend to glitch out when viewed from further away, this doesn’t happen with overlays, as seen in the gif below.</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+q+'" alt="OverlayVsFace" style="max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;"><p style="margin:10px 0;"><em>12. Overlay and face comparison</em></p></div><ul><li><code>Sky</code> shader</li></ul><p>Used for making custom skybox material. The “Sky Texture” can be added in multiple different forms. The preferred and best looking one is as an .exr file with HDR. This will however use the most file size.</p><p>The Dxt1 (LDR) option can be used if the skybox image isn&#39;t HDR. This option uses less file size. Use this option if your skybox is a simple .png image. EXPLAIN WHAT CUBEMAP TEXTURE IS AND HOW TO GET/MAKE THEM</p><ul><li><code>Csgo Moondome</code> shader</li></ul><p>Moondomes are used because toolsskybox doesn’t work properly and renders things behind it. Moondomes are basically a material shader that acts like a proper skybox material. Keep in mind that it has collision on by default but this can be fixed by changing the “Surface Property” to “Default Silent” from “Default” in the “Attributes” tab. This makes the moondome act like a clip by not leaving gunshot dents but still acting like a wall that can’t be passed.</p><p>When making moondomes it’s important to keep in mind that the “Color” setting is set to a grey colour which should be made white to not have the moondome darker than the skybox. Then choose the skybox “Cube Map” texture and you&#39;re done.</p><ul><li><code>Refract</code> shader</li></ul><p>It&#39;s broken as this is being written. Has to be rendered as a model through a “info_particle_system” entity.</p><p>Needs “FidelityFX Super Resolution” video setting disabled to show without visual bugs.</p><ul><li><code>Csgo Weapon</code> shader</li></ul><p>Can be used to make very interesting materials by enabling the SFX options “Glitter” and “Iridescence”. This shader does in fact work on other surfaces than weapons.</p><ul><li><code>Csgo Simple 3layer Parallax</code> shader</li></ul><p>Can be used to make fake rooms and layered materials such as ice. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZgSIaJoe8g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> video to learn more.</p><ul><li><code>Csgo Composite Generic</code> shader</li></ul><p>Used for loading screen images. The option A is the only one needed.</p><ul><li><code>Csgo Lightmappedgeneric</code> shader</li></ul><p>Do not use this, it doesn&#39;t work properly.</p><h2 id="models" tabindex="-1">Models <a class="header-anchor" href="#models" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Models&quot;">​</a></h2><h2 id="particles" tabindex="-1">Particles <a class="header-anchor" href="#particles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Particles&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The particle editor has to be enabled manually, follow <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike_2_Workshop_Tools/Particles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> tutorial.</p><h2 id="sounds" tabindex="-1">Sounds <a class="header-anchor" href="#sounds" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sounds&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.source2.wiki/CommunityGuides/encodingtxt?game=any" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Encoding txt</a></p><ul><li><p>Wav, mp3</p></li><li><p>Loop (wav looping with for example wavosaur)</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BqNhaPDi48&amp;list=PLHSLq5FjjRw2zPKya7QVp62XPvQUu9k-O" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Counter Strike 2 Audio Academy</a>, by Eagle One Development Team</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/xcILOV_eFCE?si=Rd26D8O4Gb3CaEyP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Custom Sounds on Hammer, Counter Strike 2, Source 2 full guide, looping sounds tutorial, area based.</a>, by Brian Vuksanovich</p><h2 id="gameplay" tabindex="-1">Gameplay <a class="header-anchor" href="#gameplay" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Gameplay&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/cs2kz-metamod/wiki/Mapping-API" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CS2KZ Mapping API</a></p><ul><li>The CS2KZ Mapping API allows maps to communicate directly with the CS2KZ Metamod plugin using specific entity names and inputs in Hammer.</li></ul></li><li><p>Major differences between CSGO and CS2 gameplay</p></li><li><p>Holding space while doing airstrafing movement when the player is on water will let the player accelerate to more than 200u/s (normal water speed) as they cycle between air movement and water movement.

To get it looking right, keep these points in mind:</p><ul><li><p>Larger Water Surface: The water area needs to be much larger than in CS:GO. This hides &quot;bad&quot; reflections near the horizon and gives the water’s edge fade more distance to blend out smoothly.</p></li><li><p>Light Probe Coverage: Depending on your layout, a single large light probe is usually best. Never let light probe edges sit on top of the water, as the seams are incredibly obvious on reflective surfaces such as water.</p></li><li><p>The 20,000 Unit Limit: Always center your water origin on the grid. Water will stop rendering entirely once it reaches 20,000 units from the origin on any side.</p></li><li><p>3D Skybox Transitions: Since the main map renders over the 3D skybox, ensure your main map geometry does not sit within the water&#39;s fade range. This prevents the &quot;seam&quot; between the real world and the skybox from becoming visible.</p></li><li><p>If your map has a low perspective and players cannot look directly down onto the water, you can get by with only water fade.</p></li><li><p>If the reflections from your env_combined_light_probe_volume look messy, identify the specific objects causing the issue. You can disable &quot;Render to Cubemaps&quot; on those individual entities to prevent them from being captured in the reflection, which often cleans up the final look.</p></li></ul><h3 id="diving-deeper" tabindex="-1">Diving deeper <a class="header-anchor" href="#diving-deeper" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Diving deeper&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If your map is tall (for example kz_avalon) the edge between the main map and 3d skybox is going to be noticeable, mostly due to lightprobes and fade.</p><p>Workarounds for this includes:</p><ul><li><p>Replacing the lightprobes “cubemap texture” with the one from the 3d skybox.</p></li><li><p>In the 3d skybox map right click your lightprobe and “Write Custom Cubemap…”, then select this .vtex file in the main map&#39;s lightprobe.
