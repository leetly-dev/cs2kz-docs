The difficulty of a course is tied to its filter&#39;s tier.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> Faster completion times and improved performance on a course will result in more points.</li><li><strong>Filter Type:</strong> Refers to the overall characteristics of the filter, such as teleport settings and other conditions.
