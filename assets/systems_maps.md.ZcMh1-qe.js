To balance creativity with fair competition, CS2KZ introduces the concept of &quot;ranked&quot; filters. This allows for diverse course types:</p><ul><li>High-quality, high-effort courses (formerly &quot;main&quot; courses in GOKZ) designed for competitive play.</li><li>Fun or experimental courses (previously &quot;bonus&quot; courses) that offer more creative gameplay.</li></ul><p>For a filter to be ranked, it must:</p><ul><li>Be a tier of 8 or lower.</li><li>Be &quot;reasonable to compete on&quot; (a subjective standard to be further clarified later in development).</li></ul><h2 id="filters" tabindex="-1">Filters <a class="header-anchor" href="#filters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Filters&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In CS2KZ, each course has a filter which represents a unique combination of mode, teleport settings, difficulty tier, and &quot;ranked&quot; status.
